acXMLreader is an in-progress tool for parsing the output of EMC's Navisphere CLI arrayconfig command into usable datastructures and/or database tables.  

This module is expected to be used as a building block in a reporting or configuration management tool, possibly with or without the SQLAlchemy backend.

Requirements:
SQLAlchemy 0.6.6
SQLite 3
