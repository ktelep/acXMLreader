History
---------------
This module was written out of the need to load Clariion information into an
existing DataWarehouse application within my organization.  As such, you may
notice that some of the tablenames/etc are not exactly "PEP8" compliant. 
Future versions will hopefully drive a rewrite of some of those table
definitions.
